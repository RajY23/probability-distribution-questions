### 1

*You are given a 20-sided die.*
- P(rolling between 6 and 9 - inclusive)
- P(rolling at least 12)
- P(rolling no more than 3)
- What are the first 4 moments of the distribution?
- Plot the distribution.

### 2

*A light switch works 1 out of 5 times. You attempt to turn the light on 15 times.*
- P(turning on exactly 9 times)
- P(turning on < 4 times)
- P(turning on >= 3 times)
- What are the first 4 moments of the distribution?
- Plot the distribution.

### 3

*A factory worker, on accident, breaks 3 widgets per hour*
- P(1 widget will be broken per hour)
- P(between 4 and 7, inclusive, will be broken per hour)
- P(less than 6 will be broken per hour)
- What are the first 4 moments of the distribution?
- Plot the distribution.

### 4

*You are given a data file, sqft.csv, that contains the area in square feet from a randomly selected houses in the United States*
- P(a house will contain 830 +/- 25 sqft)
- P(a house will have more than 3000 sqft)
- P(a house will have less that 275 sqft)
- What are the first 4 moments of the distribution?
- Plot the distribution.

### 5

*The average male height is 70 inches with variance of 5. You go to a random street corner and have a 6-sided die and a biasd coin in your hand, with p(t) = 0.6.*

- P(you will select a guy < 52" tall and then roll either a 3 or 4 and then get exactly 7 heads after flipping a coin 10 times)
- Perform a monte carlo simulation on the distribtions, say 10_000 times. Does the simulated answer equal the calculated answer.
